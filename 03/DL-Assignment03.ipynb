    "# Assignment 3 - Convolutional Network and Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn how to train a small convolutional neural network (CNN) and fine-tune this trained network in transfer learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our CNN has the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 2D convolutional layer with $Q_1$ channels, kernel size $7\\times7$, stride 1 and padding 0.\n",
    "2. 2D maximum pooling with pooling size $2\\times2$ and stride 2\n",
    "3. `Tanh` activation\n",
    "4. 2D convolutional layer with $Q_2$ channels, kernel size $5\\times5$, stride 1 and padding 2.\n",
    "5. 2D maximum pooling with pooling size $2\\times2$ and stride 2\n",
    "6. `Tanh` activation\n",
    "7. A flattening layer to turn the 3D image into a 1D vector\n",
    "8. A fully-connected layer with the appropriate number of inputs and $O$ outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will switch to an implementation in `PyTorch`.\n",
    "We will get used to some concepts in `PyTorch`, such as relying on the `torch.tensor` data structure, implementing the network, the loss functions, the training loop, and accuracy computation, which we will apply to categorical classification.\n",
    "We will see how backpropagation and weight update will be done automatically by `torch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that all your variables are compatible with `torch`.\n",
    "For example, you cannot mix `torch.tensor`s and `numpy.array`s in any part of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN will be trained on the `letters` from EMNIST datasets and fine-tuned with the `digits` from the same dataset."
